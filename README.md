it detects phishing on this website which I find hilarious because that means I really did 
make a super accurate replica Lol)

  This website is a near perfect replica of the Microsoft website. 
  It fully adjusts to the resolution of your web browser window. 
  (If you compare it to the current Microsoft website, this clone will 
  look slightly off and that's because Microsoft updated their website after I made this one.)
  =========================================================================================
  Mistake #1
  Looking back on this project, there is a lot I could've done better. The code is very unreadable
  and not scalable. I should've used more logic instead of statically creating everything. For example,
  in the slideShowControls function, each image has it's own value. All of those if else statements can be 
  compressed into a for loop. Instead of assigning the elements manually, I should've made their values a number
  and increment that number if the user clicks the right button and decrement that number if the user clicks the
  left button.
  ==========================================================================================
  Mistake #2
  I did not use MVC architecture in this project (I learned it after.) The benefit of MVC, is that it makes the code
  easier to follow and makes it scalable.
  ===========================================================================================
  Misakte #3
  I did not use parcel to prepare the code for deployment. (Didn't learn about it at the time of making this project; I know it now though)
  ===========================================================================================
  Preference #1
  I would use SASS instead of CSS
